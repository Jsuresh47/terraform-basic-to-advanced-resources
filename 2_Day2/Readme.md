🔖 This is Day 2 of learning Terraform (Infrastructure as a Code - IaaC).

So, let's get started! 🔰

✅✅ Configuration management and infrastructure orchestration with a good real-life example.
(For better understanding, visualise the whole scene just described below)

✔️ Imagine you're building a beautiful house🏡 (your computer system), and you need tools to help you with different tasks.

📌 Configuration Management Tools:

✔️ These tools are like your interior decorators and home organizers. They focus on setting up and managing what's inside your house.

🔖 For example, Ansible, Chef, and Puppet help you install and manage software (furniture) on your existing house (server).
They arrange the furniture, make sure everything is in its place, and maintain order.

📌 Infrastructure Orchestration Tools:

✔️ These tools are like your construction team and architects. They focus on building the structure of your house and the surrounding environment.

🔖 For example, Terraform and CloudFormation (AWS Specific) can create new houses (servers) and build the entire infrastructure (foundation, walls, roof) you need. They handle the big construction tasks and set up everything so that your interior designer can come in and make it cozy for you.

Sounds good, doesn't it? 😌

📌 Combining the Tools (both of them):

✔️ To create your perfect house, you need both sets of tools. Infrastructure orchestration tools build the structure (servers and infrastructure), and then configuration management tools come in to set up and manage what's inside (software and configurations).

So, the infrastructure orchestration tools get your servers ready, and then the configuration management tools take care of installing and organizing the software on those servers.

By using these tools effectively, you can create, manage, and maintain your ideal "house" (computer system) without it becoming a chaotic mess.

Everything stays organized, and you can easily make changes or add new things as needed!

✅ READY TO MOVE IN!🥳
