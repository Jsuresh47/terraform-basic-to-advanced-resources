# PROJECT COLLABORATION USING REMOTE STATES

âœ… NETWORK-PROJECT

âœ… SECURITY PROJECT

### NETWORK-PROJECT

In our **first setup**, 

we have a configuration file where we've created a special resource called EIP. 

This resource provides us with an important IP address. 

We also want to share this IP address with others, so we've created an output block that points to it. 

All of this configuration information is securely stored in a remote state, which is like a special digital safe, and we keep this safe in an S3 bucket.

### SECURITY PROJECT

In our **second setup*(a different project or configuration), 

we have a data_source block. 

In this block, we use something called terraform_remote_state to get data from our first setup. 

We tell it exactly where to find the information we stored in that digital safe (S3 bucket). 

#### But here's the interesting part: 

In this second setup, we have another file that has some special rules (like instructions) about who can use what. 

These rules reference the important IP address from our first setup.

### CONCLUSION

So, in simple terms, we're just getting some information from our first setup (like borrowing a book from a library) to use in our second setup.

That's it, and that's all there is to it!

By following this setup, you'll gain hands-on experience on the Project.

Happy Terraforming! ðŸ˜Š
