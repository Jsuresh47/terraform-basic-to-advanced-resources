🔖 This is Day 8 of learning Terraform (Infrastructure as a Code - IaaC).

So, let's get started! 🔰

🚀 AWS Provider - Authentication Configuration

Are you using Terraform to manage your AWS infrastructure?

✅ Here's a helpful tip on improving your security and resource management:

✔️ The hardcoding access keys and secret access keys in your Terraform files can lead to potential security risks if accidentally exposed, such as pushing sensitive information to public repositories on GitHub.

Say Goodbye to it 👋

✔️ Instead, leverage the power of AWS CLI to securely store and manage your credentials. Follow these simple steps:

✅ Install AWS CLI :

Get AWS CLI installed on your machine.

✅ Configure AWS CLI:

Run aws configure command and enter your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.

✅ Validate Configuration:

Test it by running aws s3 ls command to list your S3 buckets.

✔️ Hence, with the AWS CLI credentials in place, you no longer need to hardcode them in your Terraform files.

✔️ Terraform will automatically look for the AWS credentials in the default location where the AWS CLI stores them. When you run Terraform commands that require AWS access, it will use the credentials from the AWS CLI configuration.

🚀 Cross-Resource Attribute References

✔️ In Terraform, each resource represents an infrastructure object (e.g., AWS EC2 Instances, S3 bucket, IAm user etc) and each resource type has a set of attributes (also referred to as arguments or parameters) that can be configured when defining the resource in your Terraform configuration files.

✔️ When you define a resource, you specify its attributes with certain values. These values are used to determine the desired state of the infrastructure.

✅ These values end up in a terraform state file.

🚀 Let's understand cross-resource attribute references in Terraform using a simple example:

🔖 Scenario: Creating an AWS Security Group with an Elastic IP

✅ Create an Elastic IP with a "public_ip" attribute, like "52.72.52.72".

✅ When creating the Security Group, reference the "public_ip" attribute from the Elastic IP resource. Now, your Security Group is associated with that specific Elastic IP.

✅ Any other resource dependent on the Security Group can indirectly access the "public_ip" attribute of the Elastic IP.

🏗️ Terraform ensures the Elastic IP is created first, followed by the Security Group, respecting their dependencies.

🔖🔖 Remember to check the Terraform registry or AWS documentation for the appropriate attributes of each resource.
